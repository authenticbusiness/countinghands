<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Diabetes is a metabolic disease that currently affects more than 371 million people worldwide and is expected to affect 552 million by 2030. In Canada alone, as many as 2.5 million Canadians are diabetic. Whether you are Type I or II diabetic, monitoring your blood glucose levels is performed at least 1 to 3 times a day by obtaining blood from the fingertips. A pin-prick from a finger stick is a daily ritual for about 10 percent of the American population. Checking from the same fingertip everyday will cause soreness and increase the risk of scarring or even infection.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>My husband has been a Type I diabetic for many years. He finds difficulty in remembering which fingertip to check. This product helps coordinate a visual and systematic fingertip rotation for diabetics. Consistent finger rotation in blood sugar testing will reduce the risk of infection and scarring on fingertips. It is a simple and intuitive tool for a low cost that’s convenient to use anywhere throughout the day.</p>

	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	<p>Counting Hands includes a visual representation of your two hands and a clip.</p>

	1—Place the clip on one of the fingertips. This is the fingertip you will be using to measure blood glucose.<br><br>
	2—After testing, move the clip to the fingertip on the left or right. The next blood sugar monitoring will be done with that fingertip identified by the clip. Always move in the same direction to ensure consistent rotation. The clip will help to remember which fingertip to use for blood sugar testing.</p>
